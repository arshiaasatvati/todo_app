# todo_appp

This is  my new project with flutter using Hive NoSQL to build a todo app with CRUD and user friendly UI/UX.
and i Added dependency injection using Provider.
and now i used BloC StateManagement for this app using flutter_bloc package
used both Bloc and Cubit in this project to better maintainability and testing;
because it was training for me, i used Bloc on HomeScreen and Cubit for EditScreen.

i also used new widgets like ValueListenableBuilder and ValueNotifier.
but now i used provider and bloc instead of valueListenableBuilder and ValueNotifier. now i used ChangeNotifierProvider and BlocBuilder.

here are some shots and records of the app design and mechanism:
